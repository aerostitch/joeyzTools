Repo where I keep some tools I create

Warning: a bunch of them are scripts written in go that I grouped together
inside folders so, no, it's not properly testable and it's not idiomatic to run
go scripts using `go run blabla.go` but this repo is a collection of standalone
scripts and I just didn't see the point of creating 1 folder per script.
